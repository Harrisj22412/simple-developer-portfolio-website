      `Hi, I’m Jalen Harris  a passionate and versatile software engineer with experience in building modern, scalable web applications. I specialize in full-stack development, leveraging my expertise in Angular, C#, Node.js, and Python to create seamless user experiences and robust backend solutions.

With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering high-quality software solutions. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Terraform, which has given me a solid understanding of cloud infrastructure, DevOps practices, and microservices architectures.`,

`I am driven by a passion for continuous learning and collaboration, and I enjoy working in environments where innovation and creativity are encouraged. Whether I’m developing a user-friendly interface with Angular or designing scalable backend systems using C# and Node.js, I’m always looking for ways to push the envelope and improve the software I create.`,

`When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working out in the evenings, or traveling to new places to expand my horizons.

I’m always open to new opportunities to contribute to impactful projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my work, and let’s connect!`,
